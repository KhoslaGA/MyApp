              Most small businesses are stuck with one of two bad options: a
              $20-a-month template that looks like everyone else&apos;s, or a
              downtown agency that quotes $15,000 and disappears behind account
              managers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Webhub4U is the middle path. You get a modern, fast,
              search-ready website at a fair, published price — built by the
              same person you talk to on your first call. And because we build
              with AI as our core toolkit, we can add tools that used to be
              enterprise-only: an assistant that answers your phone, a chatbot
              that books appointments, automations that handle the busywork.
            </p>
            <p>
              We&apos;re based in Brampton and we work with businesses across
              the Greater Toronto Area — trades, clinics, professional
              services, and local shops that are ready to look as good online
              as they are in person.
